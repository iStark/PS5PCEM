# rdna2-disasm

A disassembler for RDNA2 scalar shader instructions, written in Zig.

RDNA2 is the GPU architecture behind the PlayStation 5. Its shaders ship as raw
GPU machine code rather than as a portable intermediate representation, so any
tool that inspects, recompiles, or validates them has to start by decoding that
machine code. This project is that decoding layer, isolated into a small
standalone library and a command-line tool.

It has no dependencies beyond the Zig standard library, and cross-compiles to
Windows, Linux, and macOS from any of them.

## Status

Early, and deliberately narrow in scope.

**Implemented:** the scalar families — `SOP1`, `SOP2`, `SOPK`, `SOPC`, `SOPP`.
That covers scalar ALU operations, comparisons, immediate forms, and the whole
of control flow (branches, `s_endpgm`, `s_waitcnt`, barriers).

**Not implemented:** the vector and memory families — `VOP1`, `VOP2`, `VOP3`,
`VOP3P`, `VOPC`, `VINTRP`, `SMEM`, `MUBUF`, `MTBUF`, `FLAT`, `DS`, `MIMG`,
`EXP`. These are rejected with `error.UnknownInstructionFamily`.

Rejecting them is a deliberate choice rather than an oversight. RDNA2
instructions are variable length, and the length of an instruction is only known
once its family is decoded. Skipping an unrecognized instruction would mean
guessing how many words to advance, and a single wrong guess silently
desynchronizes the parse of everything that follows. Failing loudly at the first
unknown family keeps every result the decoder does produce trustworthy.

Within an implemented family the tradeoff is reversed: an unrecognized opcode
yields an `unsupported` instruction with a diagnostic instead of an error,
because the encoding still tells us the length unambiguously, so the parse can
safely continue.

## Building

Requires Zig 0.16.

```sh
zig build test                 # run the test suite
zig build                      # build zig-out/bin/rdna2-disasm
zig build run -- shader.bin    # build and run
```

Cross-compilation needs no additional toolchain — Zig ships its own:

```sh
zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-linux-gnu  -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-macos      -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos     -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-windows    -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Usage

The input is a raw shader binary: a sequence of little-endian 32-bit words, with
no container or header.

```sh
rdna2-disasm shader.bin
```

```
0x00000000: s_mov_b32 s0, s1
0x00000004: s_mov_b32 s1, 0x0000002a
0x0000000c: s_add_u32 s2, s10, s0
0x00000010: s_cmp_eq_u32 scc, s10, 0
0x00000014: s_cbranch_scc0 0x0000001c
0x00000018: s_endpgm
0x0000001c: s_endpgm
```

Three details in that output are worth pointing out, because they are where a
naive decoder goes wrong:

- The instruction at `0x04` takes a 32-bit literal from the following word, so
  the next instruction starts at `0x0c`, not `0x08`.
- The second operand of the comparison prints as `0`. It is not a register but
  an inline constant: source code 128 encodes the integer zero.
- The `s_endpgm` at `0x18` does not end the program. The branch above it targets
  `0x1c`, so the code after it is reachable and decoding continues.

Unimplemented opcodes are reported in place, with the raw words retained:

```
0x00000000: unsupported family=SOP1 opcode=0x02 raw=[0xbe800200] reason=SOP1 opcode is not implemented
```

## Using it as a library

`build.zig` exposes the decoder as a module named `rdna2`, independent of the
CLI:

```zig
const rdna2 = @import("rdna2");

var program = try rdna2.decodeProgram(allocator, code);
defer program.deinit(allocator);

for (program.instructions.items) |inst| {
    if (inst.opcode.isBranch()) {
        std.debug.print("branch at 0x{x} -> 0x{x}\n", .{ inst.pc, inst.branch_target });
    }
}
```

`decodeInstruction` decodes a single instruction if you want to drive the walk
yourself; `formatInstruction` and `formatProgram` write text to any
`std.Io.Writer`.

## Layout

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [src/isa.zig](src/isa.zig) | Families, opcodes, operand kinds |
| [src/operand.zig](src/operand.zig) | Operand and inline-constant decoding |
| [src/instruction.zig](src/instruction.zig) | Instruction representation, literal fetching |
| [src/scalar_alu.zig](src/scalar_alu.zig) | SOP family decoders, comptime opcode tables |
| [src/decoder.zig](src/decoder.zig) | Dispatch, parsing a program to `s_endpgm` |
| [src/disasm.zig](src/disasm.zig) | Textual output |
| [src/main.zig](src/main.zig) | Command-line front end |

Roughly 1200 lines including tests. Every module carries its own tests next to
the code they cover; `zig build test` runs all of them.

## Design notes

**Opcode tables are expanded at compile time.** `buildTable` in
[src/scalar_alu.zig](src/scalar_alu.zig) turns a declarative list of
`{encoding, opcode}` pairs into a direct-index array, so a lookup is one indexed
load. The same pass rejects duplicate encodings and out-of-range entries as
compile errors, which means a mistake in a table cannot reach a test — it stops
the build. The conventional alternative, scanning a list of pairs at runtime,
costs up to 46 comparisons per instruction for `SOP2` alone.

**Mnemonics are not stored twice.** `Opcode` variant names are the assembler
mnemonics, so `mnemonic()` is `@tagName`. A hand-written decoder usually carries
a parallel several-hundred-line switch that has to be kept in sync with the enum
by hand.

**Errors are typed.** An invalid encoding returns a specific error
(`UnsupportedScalarSource`, `MissingLiteralConstant`, `MissingEndProgram`, …)
rather than a boolean paired with an out-parameter string.

**No allocation on the instruction path.** `decodeInstruction` and everything
below it are allocation-free; the operand list is returned by value. Only
`decodeProgram` allocates, to hold the instruction vector and the branch-target
set.

## Roadmap

1. Validate the decoder against a reference corpus of shader binaries and
   compare output line by line.
2. `VOP1`/`VOP2`/`VOP3` — the vector ALU, the bulk of any real shader.
3. `SMEM` and `MUBUF`/`MTBUF` — descriptor and buffer access.
4. Basic-block reconstruction from the branch targets the decoder already
   collects.
