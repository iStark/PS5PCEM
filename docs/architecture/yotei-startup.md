# Ghost of Yotei startup investigation

Verified with PPSA26344 and the RTX 3070 Ti on 2026-09-05.

## Reproduce

```powershell
zig build build-game-run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
.\zig-out\bin\game-run.exe "F:\PPSA26344\eboot.bin"
```

The intro decodes 582 pictures. Media Foundation reports a frame interval of
33,366,666 ns; normal movie render frames measure approximately 30–32 ms.
Vulkan SDK 1.4.357.0 validation completed an 85-second run, including the
transition out of the movie, without VUID reports.

## Remaining transition

A five-minute run continues rendering after the movie, at approximately
1.5–1.6 seconds per frame. The guest clears its active movie-controller
pointer, and the renderer resumes the full graph. This is not a decoder
deadlock.

An opt-in trace at flip 600 contains 27 draws and 137 executed compute
dispatches. The captured targets contain clears and post-processing output;
no recognizable menu text or title artwork is present. The final compositor
targets are black. No indexed mesh draws were observed in this frame.

APR resolves the shader archive, English localization, `pulse.sprig`, initial
sound resources and `v_splash_america.bsf`. The observed run never resolves
`ghost_title.xpps`, `ghost_title_0_0_0.xpps` or the common UI resource package.
The next investigation should establish why the guest has not requested the
title scene before changing its rendering passes.

The game also opens an error dialog before the movie with code `0x8002004e`
(unimplemented function). Several network-service stubs return this code;
the exact originating call and its effect on the transition are not yet
established. Error-dialog requests now retain their code and user ID in the
log before the headless implementation acknowledges them.

## Targeted diagnostics

Use `PS5_TRACE=Apr,Ampr,Dialog,PlayGo` to inspect loading and platform state.
`PS5_TRACE_GRAPHICS_FRAME=600` captures one frame's passes under `out`.
Both are expensive diagnostics and should be cleared for timing runs.

Enabling `PS5_GPU_CANONICAL_ALIASES` and `PS5_GPU_DEPTH_TRANSFER` together did
not restore the menu and increased measured frame time to roughly 1.9 seconds.
These remain disabled by default.

Audible game audio remains unverified. Observed ATRAC9 input matches the
title's `silence_5sec.at9` asset and correctly decodes to zero PCM.
