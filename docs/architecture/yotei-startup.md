# Ghost of Yotei startup investigation

Verified with PPSA26344 and the RTX 3070 Ti on 2026-09-05.

## Reproduce

```powershell
zig build build-game-run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
.\zig-out\bin\game-run.exe "F:\PPSA26344\eboot.bin"
```

The intro decodes 582 pictures. Media Foundation reports a frame interval of
33,366,666 ns; normal movie render frames measure approximately 30–32 ms.
Vulkan SDK 1.4.357.0 validation completed an 85-second run, including the
transition out of the movie, without VUID reports.

## Resource catalog transition

Guest breakpoints identified a filesystem blocker after the intro. The startup
task advances through states 3 (movie), 7 and 8, then queues the scene loader.
That loader immediately moves from state 1 to terminal state 42: its catalog
is empty, so it rejects `game.sprig` before requesting the scene resources.

The catalog reader stats `cache_ps5/load_menu_catalog.log` (11,954 bytes),
combines `st_mtim` into nanoseconds and compares it against its cached value.
The filesystem previously returned zero timestamps, matching the initial zero
cache value and skipping the first read. `stat` and `fstat` now preserve host
access, modification and status-change times, including fractional seconds.
The filesystem test suite passes all 39 tests.

With timestamps fixed, the catalog contains three entries and the loader
reaches state 9, then starts the shared resource packages, including
`core_common_subcore.core_d0_ui.sprig.xpps` and
`core_common_subcore.core_b1_fx.sprig.xpps`. The APR worker also requests fire
textures. This exposed a second blocker: the fixed 256-entry APR ID table
rejected subsequent paths with `FileTableFull`.

APR IDs now use a growing table and a case-insensitive path index. The separate
64-descriptor cache remains bounded. All seven APR tests pass, including
resolving and reading 600 files, retaining earlier IDs across table growth and
resetting the table between processes.

The combined fixes advance the loader to state 24 and resolve more than 560
unique files, including notification UI and title-stamp textures. A separate
Vulkan failure still prevents a visible menu: the device is lost after the
new scene starts submitting its compute work. The menu is not rendered yet.

Two GPU correctness fixes accompany the loading changes:

- Conservative image tracking now combines matching depth/stencil aspect
  barriers. The device does not enable `separateDepthStencilLayouts`, so
  splitting these barriers caused validation error `image-03320`. All five
  image-state tests pass, including the conservative-mode regression.
- Compute staging waits for prior readers before overwriting a clean cached
  buffer, including when page tracking is off. `gpu_dirty` only describes
  writes and cannot establish that a buffer is no longer being read.
  `vulkan-smoke --buffer-reuse` queues an actual GPU copy before changing its
  input. Without the fix it reads the replacement value `0xaabbccdd`; with
  the fix it retains `0x11223344`, for both exact-address reuse and recycling.

The full Vulkan smoke probe still fails at `InvalidGuestGraphicsFrame`, also
with the compute-buffer fix removed. The targeted buffer-reuse probe passes
on the RTX 3070 Ti. This is not a clean full-suite result.

With `PS5_DUMP_COMPUTE_SPIRV=1` and `PS5_GPU_SYNC_SUBMITS=1`, each diagnostic
compute completion now flushes and waits for that dispatch. The remaining
failure follows the second `0x80003e9600` dispatch, a 129-instruction sorting
kernel with one 64-lane workgroup. Its emitted SPIR-V passes SDK validation;
an isolated replay with synthetic counts of 0, 1, 16 and 64 also completes.
The remaining investigation needs the actual scene inputs and preceding GPU
work, rather than assuming that every invocation of this kernel fails.
The next packed clear at
`0x1d7c200` reports the lost device and should not be treated as the cause
merely because it is the first rejected dispatch.

A final normal launch still decodes all 582 intro pictures at the original
33.37 ms cadence. Synchronous shader diagnostics are kept opt-in.

## Baseline before the timestamp fix

A five-minute run continues rendering after the movie, at approximately
1.5–1.6 seconds per frame. The guest clears its active movie-controller
pointer, and the renderer resumes the full graph. This is not a decoder
deadlock.

An opt-in trace at flip 600 contains 27 draws and 137 executed compute
dispatches. The captured targets contain clears and post-processing output;
no recognizable menu text or title artwork is present. The final compositor
targets are black. No indexed mesh draws were observed in this frame.

APR resolves the shader archive, English localization, `pulse.sprig`, initial
sound resources and `v_splash_america.bsf`. The observed run never resolves
`ghost_title.xpps`, `ghost_title_0_0_0.xpps` or the common UI resource package.
The next investigation should establish why the guest has not requested the
title scene before changing its rendering passes.

The game also opens an error dialog before the movie with code `0x8002004e`
(unimplemented function). Several network-service stubs return this code;
the exact originating call and its effect on the transition are not yet
established. Error-dialog requests now retain their code and user ID in the
log before the headless implementation acknowledges them.

## Targeted diagnostics

Use `PS5_TRACE=Apr,Ampr,Dialog,PlayGo` to inspect loading and platform state.
`PS5_TRACE_GRAPHICS_FRAME=600` captures one frame's passes under `out`.
Both are expensive diagnostics and should be cleared for timing runs.

Enabling `PS5_GPU_CANONICAL_ALIASES` and `PS5_GPU_DEPTH_TRANSFER` together did
not restore the menu and increased measured frame time to roughly 1.9 seconds.
These remain disabled by default.

Audible game audio remains unverified. Observed ATRAC9 input matches the
title's `silence_5sec.at9` asset and correctly decodes to zero PCM.
